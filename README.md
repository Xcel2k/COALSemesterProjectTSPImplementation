# COALSemesterProjectTSPImplementation
Implementation of TSP in Assembly
This project was made by 3 members and it is an implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem in Assembly Language.
We used NASM assembler for our project (the 16 bit version) and we used Advanced Fullscreen Debugger to verify the integrity of our code.
